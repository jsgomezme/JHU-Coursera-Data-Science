## Coursera Data Science Specialization (Johns Hopkins University)

A place to store work I did for this specialization. I started the specialization
from Feb 20, 2016. Progress is slow due to busy normal daily work. Fortunately,
I finished all courses. The specialization is a pretty good track for R 
based data science. I learned a lot. Onward!
